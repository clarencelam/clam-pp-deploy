# Clarence's Personal Portfolio

A personal portfolio website to showcase my development projects. 100% custom built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
**Live website can be viewed at https://www.clarencelam.ca/ **

ARCHITECTURE BASICS:
- Built with HTML. Styled with CSS. On-hover animations created with CSS. On-click functions created with Javascript.
- Scrolling 'starry' background created with three.js library
- Built with an emphasis on interactivity, user engagement, and visual cleanliness. Users can toggle a cinematic auto-scroll (using website UI) to scroll through this 1-page website.

TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:
- Created a scroll-interactive "starry background" feature in Javascript by generating a 3d scene with randomized dots and scrolling the camera through the scene, with the help of the three.js library.
- Implemented custom CSS on-hover animations to give additional info when certain modules are hovered-over (such as the Portfolio section cards)
- Implemented custom JavaScript on-click functions, in order to create buttons which show hidden content upon being clicked (in the FAQ section)
